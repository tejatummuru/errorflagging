### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that the following tools are installed on your system:
- **Node.js**: Download and install Node.js (which includes npm) from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Git**: Install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

Optional but recommended:
- **Yarn**: Install Yarn via npm with `npm install -g yarn`.

### Cloning the Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

### Setting Up the Backend

1. **Navigate to the Server Directory**:
   If your backend code is in a separate directory, navigate into it:
   ```bash
   cd backend  # Adjust this path based on your project structure
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install necessary Node.js packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or if using Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure Google Earth Engine**:
   - Place your Google Earth Engine private key (JSON file) in your project. Ensure itâ€™s referenced correctly in your Express application.
   - Add environment variables as needed (e.g., PORT, GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS).

4. **Start the Server**:
   Start the backend server using:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or with Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

### Setting Up the Frontend

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:
   If your frontend code is in a separate directory, navigate into it:
   ```bash
   cd frontend  # Adjust this path based on your project structure
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or with Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the Frontend Application**:
   Run the React application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or with Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```
   This will open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

### Testing the Application

- **Functional Test**: Use the application to upload a CSV file and verify that the frontend communicates correctly with the backend, processing data as expected.
- **Console Logs**: Check both the browser and server console logs for any errors or important messages.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Dependency Errors**: If you encounter errors related to missing packages or dependencies, ensure that `npm install` or `yarn install` has been run in both the frontend and backend directories.
- **CORS Issues**: Make sure the CORS policy on your server is configured to allow requests from your frontend.
- **Environment Variables**: Check that all necessary environment variables are set correctly for the backend to function, particularly those relating to Google Earth Engine.
